# Hit first!

Hit first! is a very simple, frontend only, stateless-ish initiative tracker for Drakar och Demoner / Dragon RPG. 

It is meant as a replacement for using initiative cards, when playing remote.

Currently it is not pretty, and it is a bit lacking in features. 

Use it at your own risk.

Run it with `npm run start` and open the local webpage.

Made using Parcel, React and Bootstrap
